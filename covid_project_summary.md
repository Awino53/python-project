# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker - Summary Notes

## ‚úÖ Project Objectives Achieved

- ‚úÖ Collected global COVID-19 data from Our World in Data.
- ‚úÖ Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas.
- ‚úÖ Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values and filtering relevant countries (Kenya, United States, India).
- ‚úÖ Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- ‚úÖ Created visualizations:
  - Line charts (cases & deaths over time)
  - Bar charts (top countries by total cases)
  - Optional heatmaps (for correlation)
- ‚úÖ Calculated critical indicators:
  - Death rates: `total_deaths / total_cases`
  - Vaccination coverage
- ‚úÖ Communicated insights through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook combining code, visuals, and narrative explanations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Segments Completed

1. **Data Collection**: Downloaded dataset (e.g., from Our World in Data).
2. **Data Loading & Exploration**: Used `pandas.read_csv()` and explored structure.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Filtered for Kenya, USA, India. Converted date fields, handled nulls.
4. **EDA**: Time series analysis, country comparisons, trend analysis.
5. **Vaccination Progress**: Tracked cumulative vaccinations and percentages.
6. **(Optional)** Choropleth Map: Considered using Plotly or GeoPandas.
7. **Insights & Reporting**: Drafted findings and narrative conclusions.

## üìå Tools Used

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
- (Optional) `plotly` or `geopandas` for maps

## ‚≠ê Optional Stretch Goals (If Applicable)

- Allow user input for dynamic country/date filtering
- Interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash
- Include hospitalization or ICU data (if found)

## ‚úÖ Final Deliverable Includes

- Cleaned and processed dataset
- Time-based and comparative visualizations
- Insightful narrative using Markdown cells
- Exported report as PDF or HTML (optional)
